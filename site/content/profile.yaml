  about: |
    I am a French Canadian that somehow found my way to Stockholm. It's OK though as I love mountain biking and there is no shortage of nature around Sweden.

    I am also a (mostly) self-taught web developer and professionally experienced software integrator.

    I graduated with a bachelor's in electrical engineering before finding my place in the world of flight simulation as an integration specialist for the bigger part of a decade before the world changed last year. 

    Considering what the future looked like back then as well as my need for a change I decided... No time like the present! And lept into the unknown.  I relocated to Stockholm to be with my partner and followed through with my aspirations of mastering web development. Tackling the freeCodeCamp portfolio was what you could call my gateway drug into the world of web development.  Since completing it and armed with my newly acquired understanding of it all I have gained a more sophisticated outlook and realize how gargantuan of a world I stepped in.  I have therefore opted for focussing on improving my skills learning and building things.  As it is I am deepening my understandings of the biggest javascript libraries and tools and gathering experience following through various udemy courses of which some are listed below.

    I designed a few websites using gatsby, started tackling daily CSS projects, and am working on building a custom node JS shop as well as learning Typescript by building a custom portfolio.

    I also feel ready for an Integration and/or Full stack position which would enable me to progress on my path to web domination.

    Node.js, Python, Gatsby, React, Express.js and Typescript are all technologies I am familiar with.
