  about: |
      I am Laurent. A (mostly) self-taught programmer from Canada. 

      I graduated with a bachelor's in electrical engineering before finding my place in the world of flight simulation as an integration specialist for the bigger part of a decade before the world changed last year. 

      Considering what the future looked like back then as well as my need for a change I decided... No time like the present! And lept into the unknown.  I relocated to Stockholm to be with my partner and followed through with my aspirations of becoming a web developer.  I started by following through with freeCodeCamp's portfolio and have now progressed to making my own website discovering technologies and learning different CMS along the way.
