  about: |
    I am a French Canadian that got lost and wound up in Stockholm. It's OK though as I love mountain biking and there is no shortage of nature around Sweden.

    I graduated with a bachelor's in electrical engineering before finding my place in the world of flight simulation as an integration specialist for the bigger part of a decade before the world changed last year. 

    I am also a (mostly) self-taught web developer and professionally experienced software integrator.

    Considering what the future looked like back then as well as my need for a change I decided... No time like the present! And lept into the unknown.  I relocated to Stockholm to be with my partner and followed through with my aspirations of becoming a web developer.  Tackling the freeCodeCamp portfolio has been my first aspiration but now that it's well in the past and I have a better perception of it all I realize how gargantuan of a world web development is and am focused on improving my game learning and building things.  As it is I am focusing on learning and deepening my understandings of the biggest javascript libraries and tools and gathering experience.

    I designed a few websites using gatsby and am tacking daily CSS projects, building a custom node JS shop, and learning Typescript by building a custom portfolio.

    I am also on the lookout for an Integration and/or Full stack position which would enable me to progress on my path to web domination.

    Node.js, Python, Gatsby, React, Express.js and Typescript are all technologies I am familiar with.
